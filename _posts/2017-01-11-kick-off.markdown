That when you're setting up a [github-pages](https://pages.github.com/) blog, that
the easiest way (with Firefox) to remove a saved 301 redirect is to go into the
oh-so-useful `about:config` and change the [browser.cache.check_doc_frequency](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Browser.cache.check_doc_frequency) setting from 3 to 1. Thanks [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/12796598/435817)

Enough learning for one day ;)
