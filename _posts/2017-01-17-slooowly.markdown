I found this quite [nice site today](http://slowwly.robertomurray.co.uk/) as I was wanting to easily test some
timeout conditions in some `net/http` calls.

`"https://slowwly.herokuapp.com/delay/3000/url/http://google.com"`

It will return the call to whatever the url is, after 3000ms. Perfect for timeout testing.
